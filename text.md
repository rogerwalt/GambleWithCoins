Bet, Decide & Win!
In this game you have to bet bitcoins to win back the double amount of it. It’s not just luck which decides about the outcome. It’s all about strategy! 
You play against a random enemy and can win his bet. But be patient and play wisely! Because you do not only play a random number of rounds (between 0 and 9), you also get to know what the other decided last round. Both of you have to choose between stealing or split. If both of you decide to split, you get your money back. If one of you splits and the other steals, the one which stole gets all the money. But if both of you decide to steal, no one gets nothing!
