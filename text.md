Bet, Decide & Win!
In this game you have to bet bitcoins to win back the double amount of it. It’s not just luck which decides about the outcome. It’s all about strategy! 
You play against a random enemy and can win his bet. But be patient and play wisely! Because you do not only play a random number of rounds after a bomb explodes and no one gets paied (between 0 and 9), you also get to know what the other decided last round. Both of you have to choose between stealing or split. If both of you decide to split, you get your money back plus 10% more! But if one of you splits and the other steals, the one which stole gets all the money. Still, if both steal that's definitly not they way you want to go, since than no one gets enything!
